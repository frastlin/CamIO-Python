Ignore files
see:
https://github.com/github/gitignore
if you want a starting point for your project.

•
Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
•
Standard glob patterns work.
•
You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
•
You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters; [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (?) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen([0-9]) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; a/**/z would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on.
