# Overview:
# Need to be able to halt TTS utterance in progress,
# and need to be able to play other sounds simultaneously without disturbing TTS playback.
# To accomplish this, play .mp3 as TTS sounds, and .wav as non-TTS sounds.
# Background:
# 1) While pygame.mixer.music can only play one mp3 file at a time,
# multiple pygame.mixer.Sound objects can be played simultaneously.
# 2) gTTS only generates .mp3 files, not .wav
# 3) Jamesâ€™s experience with pygame.mixer.Channel(0).play(pygame.mixer.Sound(...)) :
# Only some .wav formats work. One is Wave PCM signed 16 bit, 16000 Hz, stereo

AMBIENT = '../res/sounds-common/beat-single.wav' #AMBIENT sound (single beat) indicates ground plane visible
AMBIENT2 = '../res/sounds-common/beat-double.wav' #AMBIENT2 sound indicates stylus visible
AMBIENT_PERIOD = 1.0 #period of ambient sound, in sec.
BLIP = '../res/sounds-common/pop.wav' #BLIP indicates we just arrived at hotspot (currently not used)
